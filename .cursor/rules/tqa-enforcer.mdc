# 🤖 TQA Core Enforcer

## 🔴 CRITICAL: NO CODE WITHOUT TESTS
- **BLOCKER:** Do not write implementation code in `src/` without a corresponding test file already existing in `./tests/`.
- **SEQUENCE:** 1. Generate test in `./tests/unit/`, `./tests/api/`, or `./tests/e2e/`.
  2. The test must follow the TQA Quality Gates before implementation begins.
  3. Only after the test is defined, implement the logic in `src/`.

## 🛡️ TQA Quality Gates (Vitest)
- **Naming:** Must use pattern `should_<behavior>_when_<condition>`.
- **Performance:** Unit tests MUST have a timeout < 100ms.
- **Isolation:** Use `vi.spyOn()`. No shared mutable state between tests.
- **Coverage:** Minimum 80% Statement and 75% Branch coverage required for unit tests.
